<!-- <router-outlet> is essential for Angular's routing mechanism, acting as a placeholder where the routed components are dynamically rendered.
    It is typically placed in the root componentâ€™s template but can be used in any component to facilitate nested or complex routing.
    It enables dynamic content loading based on the current URL, allowing you to build single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views and a consistent layout. -->
